# Brand System

This app should feel like a quiet editorial workspace that happens to be an interview coach.

## Brand Character

- Calm
- Clear
- Grounded
- Direct
- Professional without stiffness

## Product Voice

- Speak plainly and specifically.
- Favor confident clarity over hype language.
- Avoid fluff, buzzwords, and overly playful copy in core flows.
- Analysis tone should be blunt but respectful.

## Visual Direction

- Warm paper-like background, never harsh white.
- Near-black text for comfortable long-form reading.
- Soft contrast and restrained accents.
- Minimal shadows and clean borders.
- Wide breathing room and centered reading layouts.

## Typography

- Primary reading: `Source Serif 4`.
- UI chrome and utility labels: `Inter`.
- Use serif for primary content and interviewer text.
- Use sans for small labels, controls, and metadata.

## Color Strategy

- Base palette should stay warm and desaturated.
- Accent usage should be sparse and functional.
- Error states should be clear but not visually aggressive.
- Success states should be subtle and reassuring.

## Interaction Feel

- One clear action per moment in critical flows.
- No cluttered control groups.
- Keep transitions predictable and low drama.
- Prioritize legibility on desktop and mobile.

## UI Do and Do Not

Do:

- Keep hierarchy obvious with spacing and typography.
- Use concise labels and helper text.
- Preserve calm pacing through onboarding and interview mode.

Do not:

- Introduce decorative visual noise.
- Add bright/high-saturation accents as defaults.
- Overload screens with secondary options.

## Brand Guardrails for Future Work

- New components must match the existing paper/serif system.
- Any major visual change should update centralized tokens and this document.
- Prefer consistency and readability over novelty.
